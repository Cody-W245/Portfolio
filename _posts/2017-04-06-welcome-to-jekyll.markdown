description: This is my very first, all-in-one drone. There are other models out there, that require fasteners, or components that aren't essentials, so I aimed to fix that!

I started out looking for a new project to get into and I had recently taken a Coursera course on Aerial Robotics, so I was interested in getting something drone-related started. I came across this [great instructable](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1221911) on Thingiverse for printing and setting up a mini quad-copter. So I tried it out. The instructions were clear, and I enjoyed learning how to fly, but the need for fasteners, and multiple parts became aggravating. I figured, I could design and print a single body to hold all of the components, so why not?!

## Iteration 1

In the beginning I wanted to create a solid body that held the 32 bit Micro SciSky controller and all four of the Hubsan X4 H107c 8.5mm Motors. Once I was comfortable with the base, I knew I would add in the other component slots (battery and camera). I created the base to have an open bottom and rubber band straps, so that no tape was needed.
